Binance Bridge Integration

An easy way to bring assets to BSC is using the Binance Bridge. You can select many of the biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum or TRON, and convert their native tokens to wrapped tokens on BSC. The bridge works in both directions. Check out the guide to Binance Bridge here: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-bridge. 

Why Binance Smart Chain?

Safemoon Cash is, in short, a rug-proof, ownership renounced, community driven project on the Binance Smart Chain. Why we operate on Binance Smart Chain? In very simple terms, we're all about creating a (crypto)currency with tokenomics. BSC's superior speed and much (way) lower transaction fees enable us to develope future payment use cases. At this point, Binance Smart Chain might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future.
